	This is going to be a web browser based calorie counting app. There are many calorie calorie counting apps out there, 
and I've used some and from this experience would like to create an app based on my experience for the best success,
and to have this be rewarding and worth it for people, rather than just something not fun, and work heavy. To do this,
I want to focus on goals, how you can see your progress, and how you can improve in healthy ways.

	The goals page will be a big part of this. I want to try and get some app if I'm able to that has an updated 
graph that shows you progressing. I would also like the user to be able to describe their goals exactly, and why
they want to do them. The color shceme of the website is going to be black and blue, because I kind of like how
those colors make you feel more calm and productive. 

	Another app that may be harder to make is going to be a food creation and search and recording app. I'm not
sure the levbel of depth I want to go into this besides calories, if you should also be able to put in the contents
of the food like carbs and fat and stuff, but we'll see when we get there. There should be pictures with the food,
and it should be encouraged for a user to take time and really think about what they are making, and eating.

	FInally, I'm thinking of having the homepage have your daily progress of eating through the day, and how many
calories and food you've put in, and how how much water you are drinking too. This should also have some stats for
the user on how they are doing with their goals.
